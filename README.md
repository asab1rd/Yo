# YO! App

I created this project to show my skills in front end development, I'll include all the things I learned so far.

## USED TECHNOS

This project was created with[React.js](https://reactjs.org/). & [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
[React Emoji Picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-picker-react) in inputs.
[Node-SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for css.
[GSAP Animations](https://greensock.com/) for animations.
[Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate fake users & messages.
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.

Adobe XD for the Mockup.
Assembly for the SVGS.

## RUN THE FRONTEND

You must go in frontend folder `cd frontend` then you must run `npm | yarn install` to install all the required node modules.
After this you may want to build it by running `npm | yarn build` or just run it in development mode `npm | yarn start`.
`There is a problem with GSAP for the build version, I will check for further versions`

## OTHER

This readme will change as I add more features to the project.

## Future versions

#### BACKEND + FRONT Update to use a real DB for realtime data transmission, using MONGODB && Socket.iO, JWT or Passeport for authentication.
