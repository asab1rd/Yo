# YO! App
I created this project to show my skills in front end development, I'll include all the things I learned so far.

## TECHNOS
This project was created with[React.js](https://reactjs.org/). & [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## RUN THE FRONTEND

You must go in frontend folder `cd frontend` then you can run `npm | yarn install` to install all the required node modules.
After this you may want to build it by running `npm | yarn build` or just run it in development mode `npm | yarn start`.

## OTHER
This readme will change as I add more features to the project.
